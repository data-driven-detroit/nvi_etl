    This relies on the fact the the gdf is in the NVI-standard 
    projection EPSG:2898. The unit for this projection is feet,

    1 mile = 5,280 feet
    1 square mile = 27,878,400 (5,280Â²) square feet

    This will throw a warning for geographic projections like web
    mercator, and also give pretty bad results.
